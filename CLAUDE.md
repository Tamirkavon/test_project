# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Football scoreboard application with an API-Football proxy backend. Planned entry point is `app.js` (Node.js). The project is in early setup — no source files exist yet.

## Planned Architecture

- `app.js` — main Node.js entry point
- Acts as a proxy to [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/), surfacing match data to a scoreboard frontend
